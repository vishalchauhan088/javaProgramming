Topic 3: Variables and Data Types

In Java, variables are used to store data of different types. Before using a variable, you need to declare it with a specific data type. Java has various built-in data types to represent different kinds of values. Let's explore them one by one.

Integer Types:
byte: 8-bit signed integer (range: -128 to 127)
short: 16-bit signed integer (range: -32,768 to 32,767)
int: 32-bit signed integer (range: -2^31 to 2^31 - 1)
long: 64-bit signed integer (range: -2^63 to 2^63 - 1)
Floating-Point Types:
float: 32-bit floating-point number (single-precision)
double: 64-bit floating-point number (double-precision)
Other Types:
char: 16-bit Unicode character (e.g., 'A', '$', '\u03A3')
boolean: Represents true or false (true or false)



long myLong = 15000000000L; 
		In this example, the value 15000000000 is a long literal. Without the 'L' suffix, Java would interpret it as an int, which could lead to a compilation error because the number exceeds the maximum value of an int.
float myFloat = 3.14f;
		In this example, the value 3.14 is a float literal. Without the 'f' suffix, Java would interpret it as a double, which is the default data type for floating-point literals. Using the 'f' suffix explicitly indicates that you want to store the value as a float.
