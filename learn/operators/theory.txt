Certainly! The next topic we'll cover is Operators in Java. Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables or values. Java supports a variety of operators for different purposes. Let's explore some of the most commonly used operators:

Arithmetic Operators:

+ (Addition): Adds two operands.
- (Subtraction): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.
* (Multiplication): Multiplies two operands.
/ (Division): Divides the left operand by the right operand.
% (Modulo): Returns the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand.
Relational Operators:

== (Equality): Checks if two operands are equal.
!= (Inequality): Checks if two operands are not equal.
> (Greater Than): Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
< (Less Than): Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.
>= (Greater Than or Equal To): Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.
<= (Less Than or Equal To): Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.
Logical Operators:

&& (Logical AND): Returns true if both operands are true.
|| (Logical OR): Returns true if at least one operand is true.
! (Logical NOT): Inverts the value of the operand (true becomes false, false becomes true).
Assignment Operators:

= (Assignment): Assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.
+= (Add and Assign): Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
-= (Subtract and Assign): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
*= (Multiply and Assign): Multiplies the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
/= (Divide and Assign): Divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
%= (Modulo and Assign): Calculates the modulo of the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
Increment and Decrement Operators:

++ (Increment): Increases the value of a variable by 1.
-- (Decrement): Decreases the value of a variable by 1.
